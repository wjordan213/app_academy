feature additions/changes:
  -add drag factor to ship
  -change event listener on direction keys to give more consistency to accelleration
    -modify bindKeyHandlers in game view.
    -check if key is pressed at each step


refactor:
  -change checkCollisions to only check for collision with ship.
    -make sure to look at assignment before doing this
    -follow that up by changing collideWith on asteroid function because it then no longer needs to check to see if the object is an instance of ship

  -remove isShip after confirming its not needed for bullet

  -MIGHT want the draw function to be in gameview instead of game
